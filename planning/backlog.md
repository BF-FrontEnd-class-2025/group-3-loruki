## Must-Haves

> These are necessary for basic usability

- [ ] As a user, I want a navigation bar with clear and concise links so that I
      can easily navigate between sections of the website.
- [ ] As a user, I want a visually appealing showcase section with a title,
      description, and a demo request form so that I immediately understand the
      platform's purpose and can take action.
- [ ] As a user, I want to see key platform statistics (such as deployments,
      projects, or published data) so that I can evaluate the platform's success
      and credibility.
- [ ] As a user, I want to see an example of a command-line snippet in a
      dedicated CLI section so that I can understand how to install or use the
      platform effectively.
- [ ] As a user, I want a section that highlights the benefits of the platform's
      cloud hosting capabilities so that I understand its advantages.
- [ ] As a user, I want a section listing all supported programming languages so
      that I can confirm the platform supports my technology stack.
- [ ] As a user, I want a footer with social media links, navigation options,
      and copyright information so that I can easily access additional resources
      and verify the website's authenticity.
